# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Features

- Improve & expose `SentryOptions` class ([#56](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/56))
- Create or modify events using `SentryEvent` objects and new SDK methods: `SentrySDK.create_event()`, `SentrySDK.capture_event(event)` ([#51](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/51))
- Configure the SDK via GDScript and filter events using event hooks `before_send` and `on_crash`. The new `SentryConfiguration` class can be extended in a script and assigned in options to configure the SDK during initialization. However, due to the way scripting is initialized in the Godot Engine, this comes with a trade-off: a slightly later initialization. If a configuration script is assigned, initialization must be delayed until ScriptServer is ready to load and run the user script. ([#60](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/60))

## 1.0.0

### Breaking changes

- The `attach_screenshot` and `screenshot_level` options have moved to the experimental section while we're still improving things. If you previously had it enabled, you will need to re-enable it in its new location. They're currently not recommended for production use. ([#375](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/375))
- Remove `SentrySDK.get_user()` from API and ensure `user.ip_address` defaults to auto when `send_default_pii` is ON ([#392](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/392))

### Improvements

## 1.0.0-beta.3

### Breaking changes

- Bumped the minimum Godot compatibility to `4.5-stable`, locking it in for the 1.x series. ([#369](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/369))

### Improvements

  - [changelog](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#8560)
  - [diff](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/compare/8.55.1...8.56.0)

## 1.0.0-beta.2

### Breaking changes

- Configuration script support and `SentryConfiguration` class are removed. Instead, please use manual initialization with a configuration callback, if you need to set up SDK from code. See [#321](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/321) for details.
- `enabled` option is renamed to `auto_init` for clarity, and removed from SentryOptions properties (setting it from code has no sense - we auto-initialize very early).
- `disabled_in_editor_play` option is renamed to `skip_auto_init_on_editor_play` for clarity, and removed from SentryOptions properties.
- We bumped Godot compatibility to 4.5-rc2.

### Features

- Support local variables on Android ([#334](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/334))
- Allow initializing manually and shutting down SentrySDK ([#321](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/321))

### Dependencies

- Bump Sentry Android from v8.20.0 to v8.21.0 ([#352](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/352))
  - [changelog](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#8210)

  - [diff](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/compare/8.21.0...8.21.1)
- Bump Godot compatibility to 4.5-rc2 ([#356](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/356))

## 1.0.0-beta.1

### Breaking changes

First, we bumped Godot compatibility to 4.5-beta7 ([#348](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/348))

Second, we've redesigned the breadcrumb API for a cleaner, more intuitive interface. Previously, `add_breadcrumb()` method accepted 5 parameters (3 of which were strings), making it confusing to use. The new approach uses a dedicated `SentryBreadcrumb` class:

```gdscript
var crumb := SentryBreadcrumb.create("Something happened")
crumb.type = "info"
crumb.set_data({"some": "data"})
SentrySDK.add_breadcrumb(crumb)
```

For simple breadcrumbs, you can use a one-liner:
```gdscript
SentrySDK.add_breadcrumb(SentryBreadcrumb.create("Something happened"))
```

This change provides better type safety, improved readability, and enables future support for the `before_breadcrumb` callback.

### Features

- Add support for script context and variables on Apple platforms ([#306](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/306))
- Add SentryEvent.to_json() ([#329](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/329))

### Improvements

- Improve initialization flow ([#322](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/322))
- Introduce `SentryBreadcrumb` class ([#332](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/332))

### Fixes

- Potential crash in SentryLogger if removed early ([#323](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/323))
- Ensure compatibility with minSdk 24 on Android ([#324](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/324))
- Fixed UTF-8 retention problems with native SentryEvent properties ([#345](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/345))

- Filter out warnings about missing attachment files that may not exist in some scenarios (screenshot.jpg and view-hierarchy.json) ([#189](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/189))
- Fix crash in code editor when `disabled_in_editor` is ON ([#191](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/191))

## 0.5.0

### Breaking changes

- Remove `logger` argument from `SentrySDK.capture_message(...)`. This shouldn't be disruptive as the logger argument is seldom used and it had a default value. ([#162](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/162))

### Features

- Capture scene tree hierarchy data by enabling `attach_scene_tree` option ([#143](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/143))

## 0.4.0

### Breaking changes

- Renamed `debug_verbosity` => `diagnostic_level` to better align with established Sentry features ([#154](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/154))
- Mark options as basic and advanced to have a cleaner interface, and move error logger tunables into their own sub-page. This is a BREAKING change so make sure to reapply those error logger values if you're changing the defaults. ([#155](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/155))

### Features

- Introduce `screenshot_level` option and `before_capture_screenshot` hook to provide fine-grained control over when screenshots are taken. ([#153](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/153))

## 0.3.1

### Fixes

- Optimize screenshot feature to reduce stutters ([#148](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/148))

- Fixed demo project failing to initialize in exported environment ([#141](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/141))
- Fixed demo output not updating in exported project ([#142](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/142))

## 0.2.0

### Breaking changes

- Renamed the **Sentry/Config** category in Project Settings to **Sentry/Options** ([#119](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/119)). This change invalidates all previously set options in project settings. To migrate, open your `project.godot` file in a text editor and replace all instances of "sentry/config" with "sentry/options".

### Features

- In-editor class reference documentation ([#104](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/104))
- Capture screenshots when enabled via `attach_screenshot` option ([#128](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/128))

### Dependencies

- Bump Native SDK from v0.7.20 to v0.8.1 ([#126](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/126), [#133](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/133))
  - [changelog](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#081)
  - [diff](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/compare/0.7.20...0.8.1)

## 0.1.2

### Breaking changes

- The SDK no longer automatically persists user data on disk. If you want to persist user data, make sure to save it manually.
- `SentryUser.is_user_valid()` was replaces in favor of `SentryUser.is_empty()`.

### Features

- Add auto debug mode ([#73](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/73))
- New method `SentrySDK.is_enabled()` ([#82](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/82))
- Explicitly set `user.ip_address` to "{{auto}}" if `options.send_default_pii` is enabled and the user data is not set in a configuration script ([#101](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/101))

### Fixes

- Fix issues with exporting crashpad_handler dependency and resolving path to crashpad_handler on macOS in exported projects ([#108](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/108))

  - [changelog](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0720)
  - [diff](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/compare/0.7.19...0.7.20)

## 0.1.1

### Fixes

- Fix crashes on macOS with GodotSteam in the same project ([#92](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/92))
- Autofix crashpad handler executable bit permissions on macOS and Linux ([#96](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/96))
- Fix build warnings on macOS, use newer Xcode & synchronize macOS deployment target for better compatibility with older OS versions ([#93](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/93))

## 0.1.0

### Features

- Improve & expose `SentryOptions` class ([#56](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/56))
- Create or modify events using `SentryEvent` objects and new SDK methods: `SentrySDK.create_event()`, `SentrySDK.capture_event(event)` ([#51](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/51))
- New `environment` property in `SentryOptions` and better auto-naming to prioritize development environments ([#66](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/66))
- Configure the SDK via GDScript and filter events using event hooks `before_send` and `on_crash`. The new `SentryConfiguration` class can be extended in a script and assigned in options to configure the SDK during initialization. However, due to the way scripting is initialized in the Godot Engine, this comes with a trade-off: a slightly later initialization. If a configuration script is assigned, initialization must be delayed until ScriptServer is ready to load and run the user script. ([#60](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/60))
- New `dist` property in `SentryOptions` ([#74](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/74))
- Click to copy UUIDs in the demo project ([#78](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/78))
- Customize `SentryEvent` tags ([#72](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/72))

### Improvements

- Refine sentry-native build step and improve tracking of build artifacts ([#71](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/71))

### Dependencies

- Bump Native SDK from v0.7.17 to v0.7.19 ([#61](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/61), [#63](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/pull/63))
  - [changelog](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0719)
  - [diff](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/compare/0.7.17...0.7.19)

	</brief_description>
	<description>
		SentryAttachment represents a file that can be attached to Sentry events to provide additional context. Attachments are files that are uploaded alongside error reports and can include log files, screenshots, configuration files, or any other relevant data.
		Attachments can be created using [method SentryAttachment.create_with_path] for existing files on disk or [method SentryAttachment.create_with_bytes] for data already in memory. Once created, they can be added to future events using [method SentrySDK.add_attachment].
		To learn more about attachments, visit [url=https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/godot/enriching-events/attachments/]Attachments documentation[/url].

		<method name="create_with_bytes" qualifiers="static">
			<return type="SentryAttachment" />
			<param index="0" name="bytes" type="PackedByteArray" />
			<param index="1" name="filename" type="String" />
			<description>
				Creates a new [SentryAttachment] with the specified [param bytes] data and [param filename]. The [param bytes] parameter contains the raw file data to be attached. The [param filename] parameter specifies the display name for the attachment in Sentry.
				This method is useful when you have file data already loaded in memory or when creating attachments from generated content rather than existing files on disk.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="create_with_path" qualifiers="static">
			<return type="SentryAttachment" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<description>
				Creates a new [SentryAttachment] with the specified file [param path] and optional [param filename] and [param content_type]. The [param path] should point to an existing file and supports Godot's virtual file system paths like "user://".
				[b]Note:[/b] Modifying attachment properties after the attachment has been added with [method SentrySDK.add_attachment] will have no effect. To apply property changes, you need to re-add the attachment.
				[b]Important:[/b] Attachments are read lazily at the time an event is sent to Sentry.

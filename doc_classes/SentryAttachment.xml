	<description>
		SentryAttachment represents a file that can be attached to Sentry events to provide additional context. Attachments are files that are uploaded alongside error reports and can include log files, screenshots, configuration files, or any other relevant data.
		Attachments should be created using [method SentryAttachment.create_with_path], then added to Sentry using [method SentrySDK.add_attachment] and can be removed using [method SentrySDK.remove_attachment].
		To learn more about attachments, visit [url=https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/godot/enriching-events/attachments/]Attachments documentation[/url].

				Creates a new [SentryAttachment] with the specified file [param path] and optional [param content_type]. The [param path] should point to an existing file and supports Godot's virtual file system paths like "user://" and "res://". The optional [param content_type] parameter specifies the MIME type of the file (e.g., "text/plain", "application/json").
				[b]Important:[/b] Attachments are read lazily at the time an event is sent to Sentry.
